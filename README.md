## Introduction

Fire is rules-based build tool and continuous integration system.
The spark that created Fire is "state-machine meets build tool".


## Instruction

Example of state/rule in `RuleFile`:

    # Mast handles manifest updates.

    state :manifest_outofdate do
      ! system "mast --recent"
    end

    rule manifest_outofdate do
      system "mast -u"
    end

File rules are triggered when a file has changed.

    file 'man/*.ronn' do |paths|
      system 'ronn ' + paths.join(' ')
    end

To run fire, well simple run fire:

    $ fire

For manual triggers Fire supports desc/task notation:

    desc "run unit tests"

    task :test do
      system "rubytest"
    end

Manual triggers are specified as a command argument.

    $ fire test
