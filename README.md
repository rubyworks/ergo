**"Logic programming meets the build tool."**

Ergo is a build tool that promotes continuous integration via logic
programming. With Fire, the Ruby developer defines rules and state
conditions. The rules are applied when their state conditions are
met. Through repetitive and periodic application, this allows a 
project to all but manage itself!


## Instruction

### Rule Script

The rule script by default is looked up by the name `rules.rb`, case
insensitive. Where the file is found is take to be the *root* directory.
Fire will change to this directory before applying the script's rules.

If you prefer to use a different script file, you can create a `.option`
file and add a `-s filename` entry under `fire`. It can handle a file glob,
so for instance you could specify `task/*.fire` and all matching files will
be used.

Rule scripts are just Ruby scripts using a special DSL (domain specific
language). They primarily contain a collection of `state` and `rule`
definitions. States define conditions and rules define procedures to
take based on those states.

### States

States are  conditions upon which rules depend to decide when a
rules procedure should applied. General states are defined using the
`state` method with a code block to express the condition. General
states are given a specific name.

```ruby
  state :happy_hour? do
    t = Time.now; t.hour >= 2 && t.hour <= 3
  end
```

These nemed states create a method, which is called when
defining rules (see below). But states can also be anonymous.
A most useful type of anonymous state is the `file` state. The 
file state defines a condition to check files for changes since
the previous "firing".

```ruby
    file('lib/**/*.rb')
```

Another such state is the `env` state, which is used to match
system environment variables. The variable's value can be matched
against a specific string or a regular expression.

```
    env('PATH'=>/foo/)
```

### Rules

Rules take a state as an argument and attaches it to an action
procedure. When fired, if the state condition evaluates as true,
the rule procedure will be called.

```ruby
    # mast is a program to handles manifest

    state :update_manifest? do
      ! sh "mast --quiet --verify"
    end

    rule update_manifest? do
      sh "mast --update"
    end
```

To create a Rule for a file state, we can use the `file` state
method mentioned previously.

```ruby
    rule file('demo/*.md') do |files|
      system `qed #{files.join(' ')}`
    end
```

But file states are so command that using the `file` method isn't 
necessary when it is the only condition. Rules that are passed
a string or a regular expression for the state are automatically
interpreted to be a file state.

```ruby
    rule 'man/*.ronn' do |paths|
      system 'ronn ' + paths.join(' ')
    end
```

### Logic

Rules sometimes require more nuanced conditions based on multiple states. 
Fire has a state logic system based on *set logic* that can be used
to build complex states using logical operators `&` (And) and `|` (Or).

```ruby
    rule happy_hour? & file('*.happy') do |files|
      puts "These are your happy files:"
      puts files.join("\n")
    end
```

### Books

Rules can be grouped together into books. Books make it possible to
only run a selection of rules rather than all of them.

```ruby
    book :test
    rule '{test,lib}/' do
      sh 'rubytest'
    end
```

Rule books are triggered via the command line by supplying the name
of the books to be run (see Application). All rules belong to the *master
rule book* --the set of rules that are run by default when on book
name is passed to the fire command line tool. To make a rule *private*
to it's book, put `private` before the `book` method.

```ruby
    private book :test
    rule '{test,lib}/' do
      sh 'rubytest'
    end
```


### Descriptions

Rules can be given descriptions using the `desc` method. This simply allows
a developer to get a list of the available rules by using the `-R/--rules`
option with the fire command. For example, if `rules.rb` contains:

```ruby
    desc "run unit tests"
    rule '{test,lib}/' do
      sh "rubytest"
    end
```

The we can see the rule listed:

```sh
    $ fire -R
    # /home/joe/project/foo
    Rules:
    - run unit tests
```

### Application

To apply your rules simply use the `fire` command.

```
    fire
```

To run a specific book of rules, specify them on the command line.

```
    fire test
```

Rules are always run in order of definition. So if one rule requires
that another be run before it, then it must be placed after that rule.
This makes the placement of rules a little less flexible than we might
like, but it keeps out a lot of extra cruft in the way of naming rules,
designating rule dependencies and resolving rule dependency graphs.

There are only a few options the command line tool takes. Use `-h/--help`
to get the full list. For file rules a very useful option is `-n` which
will cause the digest to considered "null and void" causing all files to
appear out-of-date, and thus causing all file rules to be triggered.


### Continuous Integration

Fire can be run continuously by via the `autofire` command. To set the 
interval provide then number of seconds to wait between firings.

```
    autofire -w 60
```

This will run fire every 60 seconds. By default the periodicity is 300
seconds, or every 5 minutes. To stop autofiring run autofire again.


### Building Useful Rules

Fire doesn't dictate how rule procedures are coded. It's just Ruby. While it
does provide easy access to FileUtils methods, beyond that the how of things
is completely up to the developer.

We do offer one recommendation that will likely make endeavors in this regard
much easier. Have a look at the [Detroit Toolchain](http://rubyworks.github.com/detroit).
It has numerous tools largely preconfigured and with built-in smarts to make
them quick and easy to put into action.
