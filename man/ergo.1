.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Ergo is an \fIautological\fR build tool, in that it is used to automate build procedure via logical rules\-based programming\. The developer only ever needs to run a single command, \fBergo\fR, and the majority of maintenance details of a project are handled\. Ergo largely replaces the need of more traditional task\-based build tools, but it does not complete supplant them\. They reamin a useful complement for one\-off manual build procedures\.
.

.SH "ISSUES"
