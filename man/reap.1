.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBReap\fR is a state\-based rules\-engine powered build tool\. The developer only ever needs to run a single command \fBreap\fR, and the project built process kicks off and all details of project management are handled
.
.P
Of course sometimes a developer only wants to preform a narrow and singular task\. Reap has a task system built\-in as well that largely emulates the Rake build tool\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
These options act as subcommands:
.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-tasks\fR
Display the runnable tasks defined in the project\'s reap files\.
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help message\.
.
.SH "ISSUES"
\fBReap\fR depends on \fBRonn\fR to provide this man\-page and command help message\. Ronn depends on hpricot and rdiscount, extension libraries that are non\-trivial to install on some systems\. A more portable version of this program would be welcome\.
